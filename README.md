# Hi, I'm Floyd Virgo! 👋

### 👨‍💻 About Me
I am a developer who loves the challenge of turning chaos into structure. 

My passion lies in **automation** and **end-to-end architecture**. I don't just enjoy writing code; I enjoy building systems that work seamlessly, from the raw data extraction layer all the way to the user interface. 

I believe that if a task is repetitive, it deserves to be automated. When I'm not building pipelines or designing APIs, I'm exploring new ways to make software more efficient and scalable.

### 🚀 My Philosophy
* **Data is Fuel:** I specialize in gathering data (scraping) and making it useful.
* **Full Cycle Development:** I love seeing a project through from the backend logic to the frontend experience.
* **Always Learning:** Currently diving deep into **Rust** to understand memory safety and systems programming better.
