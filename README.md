# Hi, I'm Floyd Virgo! 👋

I am a developer who loves the challenge of turning chaos into structure by building production-ready automation systems. My work focuses on **end-to-end architecture**, where I design everything from raw data extraction layers to the user interfaces that make that data actionable.

I believe that if a task is repetitive, it deserves to be automated. When I am not building high-fidelity scraping pipelines, I am designing modular APIs and exploring ways to make software more efficient, scalable, and secure.

### 👨‍💻 About Me

* **Automation Architect**: I specialize in building complex services like **AutoSync**, which orchestrates multi-stage data synchronization from over 10 insurer portals into centralized PostgreSQL databases.
* **Full-Cycle Developer**: I enjoy seeing projects through from the backend logic in **FastAPI** to the modern frontend experience in **Next.js 15/16**.
* **Problem Solver**: I have a track record of automating insurance document consolidation from Gmail and web portals, ensuring 2-way sync and daily reporting for enterprise-level services.

### 🚀 My Philosophy

* **Data is Fuel**: I gather and structure high-value data using advanced **Playwright** automation, residential proxy rotation, and anti-bot evasion techniques to bypass aggressive security like Cloudflare.
* **Security First**: I build security into my tools, such as the **PyGuard MCP** server, which unifies static analysis and security scanning for Python codebases.
* **Seamless Integration**: My systems are designed to live in the cloud, utilizing **AWS S3, ECR, and ECS** for scalable deployment and reliable performance.
